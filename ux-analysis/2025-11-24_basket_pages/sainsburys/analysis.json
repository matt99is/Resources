The order summary shows only 'Trolley \u00a328.35' and 'Total to pay \u00a328.35' with no breakdown of delivery charges. There is no free delivery threshold indicator, no progress bar showing how much more to spend, and no visibility of delivery options or costs. Users will only discover delivery charges at checkout stage.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "This fails Baymard Institute's critical finding that 48% of users abandon due to unexpected shipping costs.

Given this is a pet food basket (dog food, cat food, cat treats), this is a critical omission. No 'Subscribe & Save' messaging, no recurring delivery options, no discount incentives for subscriptions. The page treats pet food as one-time purchases only.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "This is a major competitive vulnerability. Market leaders like Chewy, Amazon, and Pets at Home prominently feature subscription options with 5-15% savings in basket view.

However, there is no delivery cost breakdown, no VAT breakdown (though UK prices are VAT-inclusive by default), and no discount section visible. The summary updates in real-time is assumed but cannot be verified from static screenshot.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Partial compliance with best practices. The total is prominent and clear, but the lack of delivery cost visibility undermines trust. Best practice requires showing delivery costs even if calculated later, with messaging like 'Delivery calculated at checkout'.

The basket items are stacked vertically appropriately. However, the 'Book a slot' button positioning at bottom requires scrolling past all items to reach, and there's no sticky CTA visible in mobile view.

      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Meets many mobile basics (readable text, large touch targets) but misses critical sticky CTA best practice. With 65%+ mobile traffic in UK pet retail, the lack of sticky checkout button forces users to scroll extensively on longer baskets. Competitors like Amazon and Tesco use sticky CTAs effectively.

The slot booking appears to be a separate step rather than integrated into the basket view with timing visibility.",

Best practice would show next available delivery slot directly in basket view with countdown timer if applicable.

With 40%+ Apple Pay adoption among UK iPhone users and Baymard's research showing 30-50% friction reduction from express checkout, this is a significant conversion inhibitor.
