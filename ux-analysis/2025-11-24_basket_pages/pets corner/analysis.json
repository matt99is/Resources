Two prominent banners show: 'FREE Royal Mail 48hr Delivery over \u00a330' and 'FREE DPD Next Day Delivery over \u00a359'. Summary sidebar shows 'Estimated Delivery: FREE' for current basket (\u00a348.97 subtotal qualifies for Royal Mail threshold). Current basket value \u00a348.97 exceeds first threshold but below second. Bottom of page shows 'SPEND A FURTHER \u00a310.03 FOR FREE NEXT DAY DELIVERY!' in orange text with specific gap calculation. Delivery costs are transparent and not hidden until checkout.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Exceeds Baymard Institute best practice of showing delivery costs on basket page. The dual-threshold approach is sophisticated, addressing both budget-conscious and urgency-driven shoppers. Progress indicator toward higher tier (\u00a310.03 remaining) drives basket value increase.

All three items show 'One Time Purchase' dropdown but this appears to be a purchase type selector with no subscription alternative visible. No 'Subscribe & Save' messaging, no discount percentages for recurring orders, no delivery frequency options. Given this is pet food (highly suitable for subscription), this is a critical omission. The dropdown labeled 'One Time Purchase' suggests the functionality might exist but is not surfaced or is the only option.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Severe competitive disadvantage in pet retail market where subscription models drive customer lifetime value. Competitors like Pets at Home (VIP club), Chewy (Autoship), and Amazon Subscribe & Save dominate repeat purchase categories. Pet food consumers are highly receptive to subscriptions (convenience + savings). Missing the opportunity to lock in recurring revenue and reduce customer acquisition costs.

Pack size/weight is visible but embedded in title text rather than prominently displayed as separate element - critical issue for pet food where 2kg vs 12kg bags are common.

Bottom of page prominently displays urgency message: 'SPEND A FURTHER \u00a310.03 FOR FREE NEXT DAY DELIVERY!' with orange text and emphasis.
