      "observations": "The basket page shows no visible delivery cost information anywhere in the interface. The summary section displays 'Subtotal (excl. additional charges)' at \u00a325.00, which explicitly indicates shipping costs are hidden and will appear later. There is no free delivery threshold messaging (e.g., 'Add \u00a3X for free delivery'), no progress bar showing proximity to free shipping, and no delivery options displayed. The only delivery-related element is a green banner at top stating 'Morrisons Now Fresh food fast, delivered in as little as 60 minutes' with a 'Choose Now' link, but this appears promotional rather than informational about costs.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "This implementation directly violates Baymard Institute's finding that 48% of users abandon due to unexpected shipping costs. Best practice dictates showing delivery costs and free shipping thresholds prominently on the basket page. Major pet retailers like Pets at Home and Zooplus display delivery costs and free shipping bars prominently. The '(excl. additional charges)' disclaimer actively creates anxiety about hidden costs.",

No 'Subscribe & Save' options, no delivery frequency selectors, no discount messaging for recurring orders, and no indication that subscription models exist. For a basket containing pet food items (Cesar dog food, dog treats visible), this is a critical omission. The page treats all purchases as one-time transactions only.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "This represents a massive competitive disadvantage in the pet food market where subscription models are standard. Competitors like Pets at Home (VIP Club with 10% discount), Zooplus (auto-delivery), Amazon (Subscribe & Save 5-15% off), and Chewy (Autoship) all prominently feature subscription options at basket stage. Market research shows pet food consumers are highly receptive to subscriptions for convenience and savings. Complete absence of this feature is a major vulnerability.",

The subtotal is displayed in large text (\u00a325.00) with item count clearly shown. However, the '(excl. additional charges)' disclaimer creates uncertainty about the final total. No breakdown of individual item prices is visible in the summary itself - users must look at product cards. No delivery cost line item, no discount breakdown, no VAT clarification despite UK market requiring VAT-inclusive pricing.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Partially meets best practices with clear total visibility and item count, but fails on complete cost transparency. Baymard Institute research identifies hidden costs as #2 abandonment reason. Best practice requires itemized breakdown showing subtotal, delivery, discounts, and total. The '(excl. additional charges)' disclaimer undermines trust and creates the exact anxiety that drives abandonment. Strong performers show complete breakdowns with all costs visible upfront.",

Quantity can be edited inline with +/- buttons in yellow/mustard color. However, product images are relatively small for detailed verification, no nutritional information is accessible from cart view, and no direct links back to product pages are visible. For the pet food items, pack sizes would be critical but aren't prominently called out in the visible items.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Meets many Baymard Institute guidelines for product visibility in cart, with inline editing capability and clear pricing. However, image size is below optimal (100x100px recommended), and for pet food specifically, pack weight/size information is not sufficiently prominent. The 27% who abandon due to inability to verify order details would appreciate larger images and more detailed specifications. Better than basic implementations but not market-leading in pet food context where pack size confusion is common.",

The product cards show 'Detailed view' and 'Empty trolley' options as buttons. Summary information is accessible via expandable section at bottom. However, the checkout button does not appear to be sticky/fixed on mobile, requiring users to scroll down to access it. The quantity selector modal for 'Good Boy Dog Collar & Lead Set' shows large, touch-friendly +/- buttons.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Solid mobile implementation that addresses most usability concerns for the 65%+ mobile traffic in UK pet supplies market. Touch targets appear adequate (likely meeting 44x44px minimum), text is readable, and collapsible summary reduces scrolling. However, non-sticky checkout CTA is a missed opportunity for conversion optimization. Market leaders like Amazon and ASOS use sticky CTAs to keep checkout always accessible. Google's research showing 61% won't return after bad mobile experience doesn't appear immediately threatened, but the lack of sticky CTA creates unnecessary friction.",

This appears to be for a rapid delivery service rather than standard delivery information for the current basket. There are no specific delivery date estimates (e.g., 'Arrives Tuesday 5th March'), no next-day cutoff times (e.g., 'Order within 2hrs'), no delivery date ranges, and no urgency indicators on the basket page itself. The 'Delivery Pass' link in main navigation suggests delivery options exist but aren't surfaced at basket stage.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Falls far short of Nielsen Norman Group guidelines that delivery certainty early in flow reduces anxiety and abandonment. Best practice requires showing specific dates, not vague promises. The '60 minutes' messaging is for a premium service, not the actual delivery timeline for these items. For heavy pet food items, delivery timing is especially critical. Competitors like Pets at Home show clear delivery estimates ('Order by 9pm for next day delivery') and specific dates.

Only a single yellow 'Checkout' button is present, which leads to standard checkout flow. This is consistent across both desktop and mobile views shown in screenshots. No messaging about quick checkout, no payment provider logos indicating express options.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "This is a critical competitive gap. Baymard Institute research shows express checkout reduces friction by 30-50% and significantly boosts conversion. In the UK market with 40%+ of iPhone users actively using Apple Pay, the absence of this option is a major disadvantage. Market leaders universally offer multiple express checkout options positioned prominently above standard checkout. Amazon, Pets at Home, and virtually all major UK retailers offer these options. This absence likely costs Morrisons significant conversion, particularly on mobile where form-filling friction is highest.",

The buttons appear prominently on product cards, including in the modal view showing 'Good Boy Dog Collar & Lead Set Large' where the quantity selector is large and touch-friendly. The current quantity (1) is displayed between the buttons. The interface suggests immediate update functionality (real-time price changes), though this cannot be fully verified from static screenshots. A 'Remove' option is not explicitly visible in the screenshots, though standard cart functionality would include this.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Strongly aligns with Baymard Institute best practices for quantity controls. The +/- button implementation is superior to dropdown menus or text-only input fields, particularly for mobile users. Buttons are visually prominent and appear adequately sized for touch interaction. The yellow color creates good contrast and draws attention. Immediate price updates (assumed from modern implementation) would meet expectations. Only potential gap is unclear remove/delete functionality visibility. This is one of Morrisons' stronger basket page features.",

The color choice (yellow/gold) is consistent with Morrisons' brand and creates strong visual hierarchy. However, the button is not sticky/fixed on mobile, requiring scroll to access.

      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Meets Nielsen Norman Group guidelines for primary CTA prominence with strong color contrast and clear copy. The 'Checkout' label is direct and action-oriented, though some retailers use more engaging copy like 'Proceed to Secure Checkout' or 'Continue to Payment'. The lack of sticky positioning on mobile is the primary gap - best practice dictates constant CTA accessibility without scrolling.

However, these appear to be generic site-wide promotions rather than contextual recommendations based on basket contents. There is no 'Frequently bought together' functionality visible, no 'Customers also bought' sections, and no complementary product suggestions related to the pet items in the basket (e.g., no dog treat recommendations with dog food, no toy suggestions with pet supplies). The promotional carousel appears more intrusive than helpful for basket completion.",

Best practice requires contextual, relevant suggestions based on basket contents with easy add-to-cart functionality. For a basket containing pet products, the absence of complementary pet item recommendations (treats, toys, accessories, related food flavors) is a missed revenue opportunity.

No customer service contact information is displayed on the basket page. The footer contains 'Contact us' and 'Cookie Policy' links but these are standard footer elements not prominently positioned as trust signals.

Best practice requires showing accepted payment method icons, trust badges near CTA, and accessible return policy information at basket stage.
