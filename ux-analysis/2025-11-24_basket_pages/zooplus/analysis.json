      "score": 6.5,
      "observations": "Shipping costs are visible in the basket summary (\u00a31.99 to Great Britain). There's a blue info box stating 'If you add \u00a32.73 of goods to your basket, standard shipping is free!' which provides threshold visibility. However, there's no visual progress indicator (progress bar) showing how close the user is to free shipping. The free delivery threshold communication is text-only and could be more visually prominent. Current basket value is \u00a336.27 with shipping at \u00a31.99, total \u00a338.26, indicating they're close to the free threshold but no visual reinforcement of this proximity.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "While delivery costs are transparent (better than 48% of sites that hide costs), the lack of visual progress indicator falls short of best practices. Baymard recommends progress bars for free shipping thresholds. For heavy pet food products, the low \u00a32.73 threshold is competitive, but visual communication could be stronger.",

Green promotional section at bottom explains 'Save up to 5% on all zooplus Repeat items', 'Flexible adjustment of delivery interval', 'Change, skip next delivery or cancel at any time', and includes 'Learn more' link. The Trixie collar doesn't show subscription option (likely product-type dependent, which is appropriate). Value proposition is clear and compelling.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Exceeds best practices with inline toggles, clear savings messaging (15% prominently displayed), and comprehensive terms explanation. This matches or exceeds market leaders like Chewy and Pets at Home VIP. The 'Save 15%' messaging plus 'Save 10%' additional discount creates strong incentive. Flexibility messaging ('cancel at any time') addresses consumer concerns effectively.",

VAT-inclusive pricing clearly labeled. The breakdown is well-organized and scannable.",

Quantity controls are prominent with +/- buttons. Each product shows individual pricing. Cannot verify if links back to product pages exist from this view, but product names appear to be clickable elements based on standard UI patterns.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Meets best practices for pet food category where pack size is critical. The clear display of '8 x 400g' and '12 x 85g' prevents confusion between pack sizes, which Baymard identifies as common issue causing 27% abandonment.

Basket summary is accessible by scrolling but checkout CTA remains fixed. No horizontal scrolling evident. Subscription toggle switches are adequately sized for touch interaction. Green promotional section is readable and well-spaced.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Exceeds mobile best practices with sticky CTA showing price, large touch targets, and readable text.

No 'Arrives by [date]' messaging. No next-day or same-day cutoff times visible. No urgency indicators like 'Order within 2 hours for next-day delivery'. The 'Your delivery' section header exists but doesn't show estimated delivery dates in the basket view.",

Given UK's 40%+ Apple Pay adoption among iPhone users, this is a notable omission.",
