      "observations": "Free shipping threshold is displayed at the top banner ('Free shipping on orders over \u00a345*'), but there is NO progress indicator showing how far the customer is from free delivery. Current basket total is \u00a396.76 (well over threshold), so customer qualifies, but there's no confirmation or visual reinforcement. Shipping costs are mentioned in small text ('Shipping and discounts calculated at checkout') but not itemized on the basket page itself. No delivery cost breakdown visible until checkout.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Falls short of best practice significantly. Baymard research shows 48% abandon due to unexpected shipping costs - hiding delivery details until checkout increases this risk. Best-in-class retailers (Pets at Home, Chewy) show free shipping progress bars prominently ('Add \u00a312 for free delivery') even when threshold is met ('You qualify for FREE delivery!').

The basket contains Ramsay and Orijen dog food (2kg and 11.4kg bags) - prime candidates for subscription models. No 'Subscribe & Save' toggle, no frequency selection, no discount offers for recurring delivery. This is a completely absent feature in the basket flow.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Critical competitive vulnerability. Market leaders (Pets at Home VIP, Chewy Autoship, Tails.com subscriptions) heavily promote subscription in basket with 10-15% discounts and prominent toggles. Pet food is the HIGHEST repeat-purchase category in pet retail. Missing subscription option in basket represents lost lifetime value opportunity.

However, the breakdown is limited - shows 'Estimated total' but delivery and discounts are deferred ('Shipping and discounts calculated at checkout'). Individual item prices are shown in the TOTAL column (\u00a32.78, \u00a39.99, \u00a383.99) with strikethrough on sale price (\u00a312.99 for Ramsay). The summary updates position between desktop and mobile views effectively.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Good but not excellent. Clear total display meets baseline expectations, but deferring shipping/discount breakdown until checkout introduces uncertainty. Best practice (Amazon, ASOS) shows itemized breakdown with all cost components visible. The prominent total positioning and VAT clarity are strengths, but incomplete cost transparency limits score.",

Pack sizes are prominently displayed: 'Bag Size: 2Kg' for Ramsay and 'Bag Size: 11.4kg' for Orijen - critical information for pet food. Product names are full and descriptive ('Ramsay Originals Grain Free Adult Dry Dog Food - Salmon & Potato'). Brand names are labeled above product names (ANCOL, RAMSAY, ORIJEN). Price per item is shown (\u00a32.78, \u00a39.99, \u00a383.99). Links appear to be present (product names likely clickable). Variant information visible (flavor, life stage included in product name).",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Strong performance. Pack size prominence is critical for pet food category and Petplanet executes this well with dedicated 'Bag Size' labels below each product. Image quality is adequate, product descriptions are complete. This matches or exceeds typical UK pet retailer standards.

Quantity controls use large +/- buttons in a rounded container with clear visual affordance (well above 44x44px minimum). Checkout button is prominent, full-width, and appears sticky at bottom. No horizontal scrolling evident. Product cards stack vertically with generous spacing. Delete/trash icons are appropriately sized and positioned. Touch targets throughout appear well-sized. The 'Estimated total' section is compact but readable. Overall layout is clean and uncluttered.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Excellent mobile execution. Exceeds best practice guidelines: touch targets are clearly above 44x44px minimum, text is readable without zooming, sticky CTA is present, layout is single-column and intuitive. This is competitive with or superior to market leaders. Mobile-first design is evident and well-executed. Given 65%+ mobile traffic in UK pet retail, this is a significant competitive strength.",

No urgency messaging. The only delivery-related information is the free shipping threshold banner at top ('Free shipping on orders over \u00a345*') and generic text 'Shipping and discounts calculated at checkout' - which defers delivery timing to later in the flow. Complete absence of delivery expectation-setting.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Significant gap versus best practice. Nielsen Norman Group research emphasizes delivery certainty early in flow to reduce anxiety. Market leaders (Amazon, Pets at Home, Zooplus) show estimated delivery dates prominently ('Arrives Tuesday 5th March' or 'Delivery in 2-3 days'). Heavy pet food products make delivery timing especially important. This absence creates uncertainty and missed opportunity for urgency-based conversion tactics ('Order within 2 hours for next-day').",

Both are full-width and positioned DIRECTLY BELOW the primary 'Checkout' button on desktop, making them highly visible. On mobile, both express options are clearly visible below checkout button. Buttons appear to be properly sized and use official brand styling. Positioning follows best practice of express checkout near primary CTA.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Excellent implementation matching market leader standards. Multiple express options (PayPal, Google Pay) cater to different user preferences. Positioning below primary checkout is good (some best practices suggest ABOVE, but visibility here is strong).

Each product line has its own quantity control. Delete/remove option is present via trash can icon positioned to the right of quantity controls. The interface is clean and intuitive. Quantity appears editable via buttons (no dropdown or text input visible, which is preferable for touch interfaces). All three basket items show consistent quantity control implementation.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Strong implementation following best practices. +/- buttons are preferred over dropdowns for touch interfaces and immediate feedback. Remove functionality is clear via universally-recognized trash icon. This matches or exceeds typical UK retailer standards. Only minor potential improvement would be allowing direct numeric input for bulk purchases (typing '10' vs clicking + nine times), but for typical pet food purchases (1-3 items), current implementation is optimal.",

On desktop, button appears well-sized and positioned in the summary panel. No competing CTAs that might cause confusion - 'Continue shopping' link is subtle and secondary. Lock icon reinforces security messaging.",

Action-oriented copy is clear (though 'Proceed to Checkout' might be slightly more explicit, 'Checkout' is industry-standard and understood). Lock icon adds trust element.

Carousel format allows multiple recommendations without overwhelming the page. 5-star rating adds social proof.

Return policy link not visible on basket page. Customer service contact details not prominently displayed. Limited trust signals overall.",
