The basket breakdown shows 'Delivery (Estimate): FREE' clearly in the cost summary. There's also a notification stating 'Free delivery options available now \u00a335*' at the top of the page. The delivery cost is integrated into the basket summary before checkout, showing transparency. However, there's no visual progress bar showing how close the user is to maintaining free delivery, and the asterisk suggests conditions that aren't immediately clear.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Meets Baymard Institute best practice of showing delivery costs before checkout (addressing the 48% abandonment issue). However, lacks the visual progress bar that best-in-class retailers use to gamify the free shipping threshold.

There are no toggles, checkboxes, or promotional messaging about subscribe-and-save programs. No discount offers for recurring orders. No frequency selection options. This is a complete absence of subscription functionality at the basket stage.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Falls significantly short of market expectations for pet food retail. Competitors like Pets at Home (VIP Club), Chewy (Autoship), and even Amazon (Subscribe & Save) have made subscription central to pet food purchasing. Pet food consumers are highly receptive to subscription models for convenience and savings. This represents a major gap compared to market leaders who typically offer 10-15% subscription discounts prominently in basket.",

However, the total (\u00a336.37) could be more visually emphasized with larger font size or bolder styling to make it instantly scannable.

However, product images are relatively small and could be larger for better visibility. Pack sizes are embedded in product titles rather than being called out as separate, scannable fields. No explicit nutritional information or key features visible in cart view. Product names are clickable (appear to be links back to product pages). Quantity can be edited inline with +/- buttons.",

Pack size is present but not prominently called out as a separate field, which is critical for pet food (Baymard's 27% abandonment due to unclear order details). The product images are functional but smaller than best practice (100x100px minimum). Best-in-class pet retailers often highlight pack size/weight in bold or as a separate field since confusion between 2kg vs 12kg bags is a common issue.

The basket summary appears at the bottom after products, requiring scrolling. Product names are readable without zooming. The PayPal checkout button is also full-width.

For heavy items like dog food, delivery timing is particularly important but completely absent.",

Best practice is to show specific dates, not vague terms like 'estimate'.

With 40%+ UK iPhone users actively using Apple Pay and high Google Pay adoption on Android, VioVet is missing major express checkout opportunities. Baymard Institute research shows express checkout reduces friction by 30-50% and significantly boosts conversion.
