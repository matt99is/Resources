However, delivery costs are NOT shown on this basket page. The page prominently features 'Book a slot' CTA multiple times, but users must proceed to delivery slot selection to see actual delivery costs. No progress indicator showing how close user is to \u00a325 threshold. The \u00a35 minimum basket charge warning is visible but delivery fee structure is opaque until next step.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Falls short of Baymard Institute best practice (48% abandon due to unexpected shipping costs). Major gap: delivery costs hidden until slot booking stage. The \u00a325 minimum basket threshold is communicated but not visualized with progress bar. Users cannot compare delivery options or costs from basket view, creating friction and potential abandonment when costs revealed later.",

      "observations": "No subscription or auto-delivery functionality visible anywhere on the basket page. No 'Subscribe & Save' options, no recurring delivery setup, no discount incentives for subscription. This is a critical gap for pet food products (all three items are dog food/toys). Users can only complete one-time purchases. The 'Allow substitutions' checkbox is visible for each product, but this is for out-of-stock substitutions, not recurring orders.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Complete absence of subscription functionality is a massive competitive vulnerability in pet food retail. Market leaders like Pets at Home VIP and Chewy Autoship capture customer lifetime value through subscription models with 10-15% discounts. Tesco is missing out on recurring revenue and customer retention mechanisms that are standard in this category. This is especially critical given all products in basket are pet food/supplies with predictable repeat purchase patterns.",

Subtotal calculation visible: '3 items Subtotal \u00a319.25'. The breakdown is clean and well-structured. Warning about \u00a325 minimum basket charge is clear. However, delivery costs are NOT included in this total, making it incomplete. The 'estimated' qualifier on total is appropriate. Clubcard savings are prominently highlighted in yellow, creating value perception.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Partially meets best practices. Total is prominent and clearly displayed. Savings are highlighted effectively. However, the total is incomplete without delivery costs, which contradicts Baymard Institute finding that hidden costs are #2 abandonment reason. The estimated total approach is honest but incomplete. Real-time updates would need to be tested, but UI suggests modern implementation.",

Product images are clear and recognizable. Pack size is integrated into product name. The 'Best of shelf' indicator and promotional badges provide additional context.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Strong implementation meeting most best practices. Product images are clear (though slightly smaller than 100x100px ideal). Pack size is prominently displayed in product name, addressing pet food-specific concern about weight confusion. Price per kg/unit helps comparison. Inline quantity editing is present.

Touch targets are appropriately sized: +/- quantity buttons are large circular buttons (easily 44x44px), 'Book a slot' button is full-width and prominent. Basket Summary is accessible at top of mobile view with collapsible section. No horizontal scrolling evident. Quantity selectors are touch-friendly with clear tap zones. Product cards are well-spaced. The mobile layout reflows appropriately with basket summary at top, then product list vertically stacked.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Excellent mobile implementation meeting Google and accessibility guidelines. Touch targets meet 44x44px minimum. Text is readable. Layout is logical for mobile flow. The 'Book a slot' CTA is prominent but NOT sticky at bottom (minor gap). Overall, this is strong mobile UX that won't create abandonment due to usability issues.

There's urgency messaging about delivery dates: 'Offer valid for delivery from 07/10/2025 until 08/10/2025' visible on products. However, no active delivery estimate or countdown timer showing when user needs to order for next available slot. The slot booking mechanism is visible but requires user action to see available times.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Partially meets best practices. Slot-based delivery system is appropriate for grocery, but lacks proactive urgency indicators ('Order within 2 hours for tomorrow delivery'). No specific delivery date shown for current basket. Nielsen Norman Group recommends delivery certainty early in flow; here users must click through to slot booking to see options. The expired slot warning is clear but doesn't guide user to resolution.

Only standard 'Book a slot' button is present, which leads to traditional checkout flow. This is particularly notable given UK's high Apple Pay adoption (40%+ of iPhone users). The absence is conspicuous and represents significant friction compared to modern e-commerce standards.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Major competitive vulnerability. Baymard Institute research shows express checkout reduces friction by 30-50% and significantly boosts conversion. UK market has very high Apple Pay adoption. Competitors offering one-tap checkout have massive advantage in conversion rates.

This is a missed revenue opportunity, especially given basket contains pet food where accessories, treats, and related items have high attach rates.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Significant gap compared to e-commerce best practices. Amazon attributes 35% of revenue to recommendations.

Customer service links available in footer ('Here to help', 'Help & FAQs', 'Product Recall'). Tesco brand itself carries trust, but security messaging is minimal.

Payment method icons are present but not prominent near CTA where Baymard Institute recommends placement (18% abandon due to trust concerns). Tesco brand provides inherent trust as major UK retailer.
