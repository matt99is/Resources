Thumbnails are navigable with left/right arrows. The main image appears zoomable (magnifying glass icon visible in bottom-left corner of hero image).

Zoom capability appears present, addressing the Baymard finding that 40% of mobile sites don't support zoom.

Button is large, easily tappable, and uses clear action-oriented text 'Add'. The button appears to meet 44x44 pixel minimum for mobile touch targets. Stock availability is not explicitly shown but implied by active button state. The 'Buy' section is clean with minimal clutter - only quantity selector and Add button, no competing elements. Below the Add button is the distinctive yellow Clubcard Price badge, which is complementary rather than distracting. On the right-side basket panel, the basket count (0 items) and checkout button are visible, suggesting post-add feedback mechanism.

Button styling is unique and not replicated elsewhere on the page. High contrast blue against white background creates strong visual prominence. Clear positioning and size likely drive the 32% conversion increase that Baymard associates with large, high-contrast CTAs.

No original price strikethrough visible (possibly this IS the regular price and Clubcard is the discount tier).

Clear discount communication (Clubcard savings) addresses Nielsen Norman Group's finding that showing savings increases purchase likelihood by 27%. Offer validity dates provide transparency beyond what most competitors offer. No hidden fees detected in primary view.

The 87% of sites that don't respond to negative reviews likely includes Tesco (no evidence of responses). However, the prominent placement of the aggregate 4.8-star rating with review count does provide baseline social proof, potentially contributing to Nielsen Norman Group's finding that products with reviews see 270% higher conversion.

This is appropriate for a grocery retailer selling perishable/consumable goods where customers may prefer to control order timing through standard reordering rather than auto-delivery. CRITICAL DARK PATTERN CHECK: N/A - no subscription option exists, therefore no pre-selection dark pattern is possible. This is not a vulnerability but rather a business model choice appropriate for grocery retail.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Not applicable for competitive disadvantage assessment. While subscription models work well for certain product categories (pet food could theoretically support auto-delivery), Tesco's grocery business model focuses on recurring shop visits and basket building rather than single-product subscriptions. The absence of subscription avoids any dark pattern risks. UK CMA guidance on pre-selected subscriptions is not relevant here. For pet food specifically, some competitors (Chewy, Amazon) do offer Subscribe & Save, which provides convenience and discount incentives, so this could be viewed as a feature gap.

Up-front policy disclosure (returns, privacy) addresses Nielsen Norman Group's finding that policy visibility reduces cart abandonment. The 4.8-star rating serves as social proof trust indicator.
