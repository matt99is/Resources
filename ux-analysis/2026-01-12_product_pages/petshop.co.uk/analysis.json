No obvious 360-degree views, video demonstrations, or descriptive text overlays on images are visible. In-use/contextual imagery is present for some products (e.g., dog treats showing product in-context). Mobile view shows standard tap-to-view functionality but pinch-to-zoom capability cannot be verified from screenshot.
