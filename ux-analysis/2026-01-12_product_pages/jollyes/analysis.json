The main image appears to be high-resolution and shows the product packaging clearly. However, no visible zoom icon or zoom functionality indicators are apparent in the screenshot. No descriptive text or graphics overlay on images highlighting key features (e.g., '15kg', 'Salmon & Trout', ingredient callouts). No in-use imagery showing dogs eating the food or contextual lifestyle shots. Mobile optimization cannot be fully assessed from desktop view, but thumbnail navigation appears present. The gallery is functional but basic - meets minimum standards but doesn't excel.",

The 52% of sites that don't include descriptive text/graphics on images - Jollyes is in this majority, missing an opportunity. No evidence of 360-degree view or video demonstration.

Button is large and positioned in a dedicated purchase section on the right side of the page. Text is clear and action-oriented. Stock availability is clearly indicated above with '24 In stock' in green text. The button appears to meet minimum 44x44 pixel touch target requirements. However, the 'Buy' section includes competing elements: Subscribe & Save option above, quantity selector, and two additional buttons below ('Add to basket' and 'Buy Now'). The presence of multiple CTAs and subscription options creates some visual competition, though the red styling provides differentiation.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "The large, high-contrast CTA aligns with Baymard's 32% conversion increase findings. However, falls into the 56% of sites with 'bloated Buy sections' - the subscription option, quantity selector, and multiple buttons create clutter that reduces primary CTA effectiveness.

However, no express payment buttons are visible - no Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal Express, Amazon Pay, or Shop Pay buttons present on the product page. The 'Buy Now' functionality suggests a faster checkout path, but lacks the one-click convenience of true express payment options. This is a significant gap in modern e-commerce UX, especially for repeat customers who expect frictionless checkout.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Fails to meet industry standards where sites with Apple Pay/Google Pay see 2x faster purchase completion. Missing the express checkout options that Nielsen Norman Group identifies as essential for 'hassle-free checkout'. While the 'Buy Now' button provides some acceleration, it lacks the saved payment method convenience that reduces cart abandonment.

Key features appear in the description area. A specifications table is visible showing details like 'Brand', 'Suitable For', 'Weight', 'Life Stage'. The content organization uses a vertical layout with sections rather than horizontal tabs, which is good.

This indicates that subscription is PRE-SELECTED BY DEFAULT, forcing users to actively deselect to make a one-time purchase. The subscription option is positioned first/above the one-time option, creating visual hierarchy favoring recurring commitment. The subscription does show clear savings: '£42.98 (£2.87 / kg)' vs '£45.24 (£3.02 / kg)', and includes 'Subscribe to monthly deliveries & save 5%' text. However, the pre-selection manipulates user choice by exploiting inattention and default bias.

Exploits the 27% higher selection rate for pre-selected defaults documented in CMA's analysis of 58 studies. While transparency of terms and savings calculation is good, the pre-selection overshadows these positives. Baymard's finding that pre-selected subscriptions reduce trust by 23% applies directly.
