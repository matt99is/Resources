Quantity selector (- 1 +) positioned immediately to the left of the CTA. Mobile: 'ADD TO CART' button uses same teal styling, appears adequately sized for touch targets.

Avoids the 56% of sites with bloated Buy sections - this implementation is clean and focused. Cannot verify post-add feedback without interaction.

VISUAL INSPECTION: The 'ONE-TIME PURCHASE' button appears to have a WHITE background with dark border/text, while the 'SUBSCRIBE' button appears LIGHTER/GRAYED OUT. This visual treatment suggests ONE-TIME PURCHASE is currently SELECTED (active state), NOT subscription. This is ETHICAL DEFAULT BEHAVIOR - one-time purchase is the default, user must actively choose subscription. Subscription value proposition is crystal clear: 'SAVE 33%' prominently displayed with specific pricing (£29.84 vs £44.99). Subscription option is highly visible above the fold, positioned prominently in the Buy section with equal visual weight to one-time option. Toggle mechanism appears easy to use.

This ethical approach builds trust rather than manipulating users. Strong value proposition communication (33% savings) meets Nielsen Norman Group standards. Subscription visibility above fold is excellent. However, cannot verify if cancellation terms are clearly disclosed before commitment (Baymard standard).
