No visible zoom icon or magnification controls. Mobile view shows same single image with swipeable carousel indicated by dots. No descriptive text overlays on product image. No video content visible.

Sites with 5+ images see 19% higher conversion, and while 5 images may exist (based on carousel dots), only 1 is immediately visible. The 52% of sites that don't include descriptive text/graphics on images - Viovet is in this underperforming group. No visible zoom functionality contradicts the 40% benchmark for mobile pinch-to-zoom support (cannot verify if present).

Product page shows 'Select a product...' dropdown menu under 'Size / Type' section, indicating user must select variant before CTA appears. This creates friction in the purchase flow. The price range '£37.15 to £72.98' displayed prominently, but primary purchase action is hidden behind variant selection. Dropdown states 'Selection of 2 products from' suggesting multiple SKUs. Cart icon visible in header (0 items, £0.00) but no product-level add action visible. On mobile, same pattern - dropdown but no CTA button visible.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Severe competitive vulnerability. Baymard research shows large, high-contrast CTAs increase conversions by 32%, yet no CTA is visible at all without interaction. This violates the fundamental principle that the Add to Cart button should be positioned in a dedicated 'Buy' section with minimal clutter and high visual prominence. The 56% of sites with bloated 'Buy' sections is actually better than this - Viovet doesn't show a 'Buy' section at all in initial view. Fails Nielsen Norman Group's 44x44 pixel minimum for mobile touch targets because button isn't visible. No stock availability indication near CTA because no CTA exists.",

Baymard Institute research shows express checkout options on product page reduce steps to purchase and cart abandonment.

No radio buttons, checkboxes, or toggle switches for recurring purchase. No 'Subscribe & Save' section. No default selection dark pattern present because feature doesn't exist. This is actually a positive finding from ethical UX perspective - Viovet does not use manipulative pre-selected subscription tactics. However, for pet food products (recurring purchase category), absence of subscription option represents missed revenue opportunity rather than ethical choice. Cannot verify if this is intentional ethical decision or simply feature gap.",

Pet food is ideal category for subscription (recurring need, predictable consumption). UK CMA Online Choice Architecture guidance on pre-selected subscriptions is not relevant as feature doesn't exist. Nielsen Norman Group's emphasis on clear subscription terms and cancellation policy cannot be evaluated. Baymard's 23% trust reduction from pre-selected subscriptions is avoided. However, modern pet supply competitors like Chewy, Petco, and Amazon offer subscription discounts (typically 5-15% off) that drive customer lifetime value.
