- **Opportunity:** Limited product imagery (2-3 views only) falls well below Nielsen Norman recommendation of 5+ images and lacks in-use contextual photos, 360-degree views, or video content that drive 19% higher conversion
- **Opportunity:** No visible third-party trust badges (Norton, Google Trusted Store, BBB) on product page misses opportunity for 42% conversion lift and fails to leverage top trust seals

| Mobile Product Page Optimization | 7.5/10 | ✓ Market Parity |

#### Competitive Advantages

- **Threat:** Exceptional social proof implementation with ratings distribution, verified purchase badges, and prominent 13-review display that builds trust and addresses the 95% of users who read reviews before purchasing
- **Threat:** Ethical subscription offering with clear 5% savings value proposition, delivered without dark patterns - one-time purchase is default, avoiding the manipulative pre-selection that damages trust and may breach UK CMA guidelines
- **Threat:** Comprehensive product imagery with 5+ high-quality images including descriptive text overlays, nutritional panels, and in-use context that exceeds the 4-5 image benchmark and addresses the 56% of users who cite images as most important factor

#### Exploitable Vulnerabilities

- **Opportunity:** Complete absence of express payment options (Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal Express, Amazon Pay) on product page - missing 2x faster purchase completion opportunity and failing to meet modern shopper expectations for hassle-free checkout
- **Opportunity:** No expected delivery date displayed on product page despite Nielsen Norman Group research showing 18% conversion increase from this feature, forcing users to estimate or abandon
- **Opportunity:** Limited trust badge diversity with only Feefo visible - missing opportunity for 42% conversion improvement from multiple trust seals like Norton SSL, Google Trusted Store, or BBB that top e-commerce sites display
