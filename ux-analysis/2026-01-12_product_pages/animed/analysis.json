Thumbnails include: main product image, nutritional info panels, ingredient lists, feeding guide, and dog lifestyle image. The main image appears to be high-resolution (zoom capability likely present given standard e-commerce patterns). Mobile view shows swipeable carousel with dots indicating multiple images. However, no visible descriptive text or graphics overlaid on images highlighting key features. No 360-degree view or video demonstration visible. In-use imagery is present (dog with product). Mobile view appears to support tap navigation through image carousel.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Meets baseline expectations with 7+ images (exceeding Nielsen's 5+ recommendation). However, falls short on Baymard's finding that 52% of sites don't include descriptive text/graphics on images - this site appears to be in that 52%.

Desktop view shows button in a clean 'Buy' section with quantity selector and price (£36.99) immediately above. Text is clear and action-oriented ('Add to Basket'). Button uses unique styling not replicated elsewhere on the visible page. Stock availability is not explicitly shown, but PayPal messaging '3 interest free payments or purchases from £30-£2,000' appears directly above button, which slightly clutters the buy section. Post-add feedback not visible in static screenshot.",

Baymard Institute and Nielsen Norman Group research indicates express payment options reduce friction and cart abandonment. Sites with Apple Pay/Google Pay see 2x faster purchase completion.

The 2kg option appears to have a filled circle (•) indicating it is selected by default. No visible subscription or auto-delivery option is present in the screenshot.
