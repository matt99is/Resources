No alternative angles, no 360-degree view, no video demonstration, and no in-use contextual imagery showing a dog eating the food or product in real-world scenario. A zoom icon is present in bottom right of main image, suggesting zoom capability exists. The color/variant selector shows 6 small thumbnails (brown, green, yellow, orange, red, purple) but these appear to be different product variants, not additional views of the current product. No descriptive text or graphics overlaid on the image highlighting key features like 'Small Dog' or 'High in Poultry'.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Falls significantly below Baymard Institute benchmark of 4-5 distinct views per product. 56% of users cite product images as most important purchase factor, yet this page provides minimal visual information. Aligns with the 52% of sites that don't include descriptive text/graphics on images. The single-image approach creates a major information gap for users who rely heavily on visual product assessment.",

The button is large (appears to meet 44x44px mobile minimum) and positioned in a dedicated purchase area. Clear stock availability indicated ('In stock online'). The button text is action-oriented and uses British terminology ('trolley' vs 'cart'). However, the Buy section includes competing elements: a quantity selector dropdown, size selector ('3 kg'), and a 'Shop similar' link directly adjacent to the primary CTA, creating some visual clutter. The green banner above ('Save 15% when you subscribe...') adds additional visual noise near the primary conversion action.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Partially aligns with Baymard best practices for CTA prominence with strong color contrast and clear positioning. However, falls into the 56% of sites with bloated 'Buy' sections that have competing elements reducing CTA effectiveness. The proximity of 'Shop similar' link to the primary CTA is a distraction that could reduce conversion by splitting user attention.",

Nielsen Norman Group emphasizes that shoppers demand hassle-free checkout with one-click or saved payment methods.

Original price (£9.41) is struck through and de-emphasized. The savings amount ('Save £1.41') is highlighted in red text. Price per unit is clearly visible ('£2.67/kg'), addressing the 86% gap where sites don't show this.

The green banner calculates the subscription price ('only £6.80') making the value proposition crystal clear.

No indication of hidden shipping costs, though delivery fees are not explicitly stated on the product page itself.",

Strong savings calculation visible, aligning with Nielsen Norman's finding that showing savings amounts increases purchase likelihood by 27%.

Content is organized in vertical sections/accordions avoiding horizontal tabs. Ingredients and nutritional information appear to be present in expandable sections. However, there are no scannable feature highlights in bullet format above the description - the text is presented as a dense paragraph. No visible specifications table with dimensions, weight beyond the package size. The 'Return To Address' section provides some additional detail but is oddly positioned.

The paragraph format requires users to read dense text rather than scan key benefits. Avoids the 27% horizontal tab pitfall by using vertical organization. Provides adequate basic information but misses the Baymard benchmark of 3-5 scannable feature highlights that 83% of users need.

The radio button for 'One-off purchase' appears to be the default selected option (though the screenshot quality makes definitive determination difficult). The subscription option is prominently displayed in a green banner above the purchase section with clear value proposition ('Save 15% when you subscribe & save. Buy this product regularly for only £6.80'). The terms are transparent with subscription frequency visible ('Delivered: Every 4 weeks'). However, the green banner creates significant visual prominence that could be seen as favoring subscription over one-time purchase. The 'Change' link suggests subscription settings are easily adjustable. No visible dark patterns of pre-selection detected, but the visual hierarchy strongly promotes subscription.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Does NOT violate UK CMA dark pattern guidance as subscription does not appear pre-selected. However, the prominent green banner treatment creates visual emphasis that borders on aggressive promotion. Subscription terms are clear, addressing Nielsen Norman's guidance on transparency. The 15% savings is clearly communicated. The opt-out mechanism ('Change' link) appears accessible. Subscription visibility above fold is strong.

Review verification indicators present ('Verified purchase' badges on reviews). Return policy link visible in top navigation ('Help & FAQs').

Overall trust is adequate but relies more on brand reputation than explicit trust signals.",

No Norton SSL seal (35.4% top performer), no Google Trusted Store (20.9%), no BBB (15.7%). However, Nielsen Norman notes that design quality is the first trust indicator, which is solid.

The layout appears responsive with potential for mobile adaptation. Touch targets for the 'Add to trolley' button appear to meet 44x44px minimum. The page structure suggests potential horizontal scrolling issues on mobile due to the tabular layout of similar products.
