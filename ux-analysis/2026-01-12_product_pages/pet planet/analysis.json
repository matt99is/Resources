A gallery of 5 thumbnail images is visible below the main content, showing: bag closeup, dog with product, product features graphic, feeding guide table, and ingredient illustrations. However, the main product image appears relatively small and positioned below the fold in the initial view. No visible zoom capability indicators (magnifying glass icon, '+' symbols) are present on the primary image. No 360-degree view or video demonstration visible. The thumbnails do include descriptive graphics (feeding guide, ingredient breakdown) which is a positive. Mobile gesture support cannot be verified from desktop screenshot.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Falls short of Baymard's finding that 56% of users cite product images as most important - the single small primary image lacks prominence. The 5 images total is close to Nielsen's recommendation of 5+ images (19% higher conversion), but they're relegated to thumbnails. Positively, descriptive graphics are present (52% of sites lack this per Baymard 2025). No visible zoom functionality represents a significant gap given that 40% of mobile sites already fail to support pinch-to-zoom gestures.",

The button appears to be adequately sized and uses distinctive styling. It's positioned within a dedicated 'Buy' section alongside bag size selector (1kg/15kg radio buttons) and quantity controls. The button text is clear and action-oriented. Stock status indicator shows 'IN STOCK' in green with a checkmark above the CTA. However, the 'Buy' section also includes competing elements: subscription option ('Subscribe & save up to 10% on every order'), one-time purchase option, and auto-delivery messaging, creating some visual clutter that dilutes CTA focus per Baymard's 56% bloated buy section finding.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "The CTA meets basic requirements for prominence and clarity, with good stock indication. However, the 'Buy' section contains multiple competing elements (subscription toggle, delivery messaging) that reduce effectiveness - directly aligning with Baymard 2025's finding that 56% of sites have bloated buy sections. The button appears to meet mobile touch target minimums (44x44px) though exact measurement cannot be verified from screenshot.

Nielsen Norman Group emphasizes that shoppers demand hassle-free checkout with one-click or saved payment methods. Baymard Institute research shows express checkout options on product page reduce steps to purchase and cart abandonment. Industry research indicates sites with Apple Pay/Google Pay on product page see 2x faster purchase completion.

The percentage discount and monetary savings are not explicitly calculated in a separate callout, but the strike-through pricing makes the discount clear. For the subscription option, additional savings messaging states 'save up to 10%' and '£14.35' subscription price is displayed. 'One time purchase' shows the £15.95 price. Delivery information is provided below with 'Auto renewal, skip or cancel anytime' messaging. No price-per-unit calculation is visible for the multi-size options (1kg vs 15kg bags), which is a gap.",

However, missing price-per-unit display for the 1kg vs 15kg size options represents a gap: Baymard 2025 found 86% of sites don't display price per unit for multi-quantity items, and Pet Planet falls into this majority.

An 'About Ferguson Fine Food for Dogs' section provides detailed product description with multiple paragraphs covering nutrition philosophy, ingredient quality, and health benefits. Bullet points with checkmarks highlight key features: 'Immune Support', 'Healthy Vision', 'Healthy Fibre', 'Healthy Heart', 'Skin & Coat Care'.

The feeding guide is exceptionally detailed and addresses key buying questions for pet food category. The use of vertical accordions rather than horizontal tabs avoids the 27% user content-overlooking problem Baymard identified with tab layouts.

No individual review excerpts or recent reviews are displayed on the product page itself. No review verification indicators (verified purchase badges) are visible. No evidence of site responses to reviews is present. The review count is relatively low (21 reviews) which may indicate either a newer product or lower review collection rate.

No ratings distribution, no visible review excerpts, and no response to reviews (87% of sites don't respond per Baymard) represent significant gaps.

The subscription section states 'Subscribe & save up to 10% on every order' with price shown as '£14.35'. Below this is 'One time' option showing '£15.95'. The subscription option is visually emphasized with the messaging 'Auto renewal, skip or cancel anytime' and 'Trusted and secure' with a lock icon.

UK CMA Guidance (2022) states pre-selecting options that commit consumers to ongoing payments may breach consumer protection law. Baymard Institute found pre-selected subscriptions reduce trust and increase abandonment by 23%. While the subscription terms are reasonably clear (frequency, cancellation policy visible), the pre-selected default undermines informed consent and violates ethical design principles.
