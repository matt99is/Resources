Instead, the page displays an error state with a generic illustration of a colander/strainer graphic (appears to be a 'no results' or 'empty state' illustration). The user searched for 'dog food' and received an error message: 'Sorry, we're having trouble showing your items right now. Try refreshing the page to see if that fixes the problem.' with a 'Try again' button.

Baymard Institute research shows 56% of users cite product images as the most important purchase decision factor, yet this page displays zero product content.

Baymard Institute benchmarks indicate large, high-contrast CTAs can increase conversions by 32%, but there is no CTA present at all.

Industry research shows sites with Apple Pay/Google Pay on product pages see 2x faster purchase completion, but this is irrelevant when the entire product page has failed to load.

Top trust seals (Norton SSL 35.4%, Google Trusted Store 20.9%, BBB 15.7%) are absent. Nielsen Norman Group emphasizes design quality as the first indicator of trustworthiness - while the error state is professionally designed, it still represents a system failure that damages trust.

The navigation menu is accessible via a hamburger icon (visible as three horizontal lines in top-left). The search bar is present and functional (user was able to enter 'dog food'). The 'Try again' button appears large enough for touch interaction (likely meets 44x44 pixel minimum). The header shows 'Log in / Register' link. However, there are no product images to evaluate swipeable carousels, no zoom functionality to test, no product details to assess readability, and no 'Add to Cart' button to evaluate sticky positioning. The error message is readable without horizontal scrolling. Critical information about the system failure is visible above the fold.",

Baymard reports 61% of mobile users won't return after poor mobile experience - this system failure qualifies as extremely poor experience. 40% of sites don't support pinch-to-zoom, but this site has no images to zoom.

    "No search result alternatives - the error could suggest related categories, popular products, or recent searches instead of just displaying nothing",
