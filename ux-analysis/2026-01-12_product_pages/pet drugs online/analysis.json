Value proposition clearly communicated with specific savings (£9.56) meeting best practices. Frequency and cancellation terms visible, addressing Nielsen's guidance on clear terms before commitment. Layout suggests one-time purchase is default with subscription as value-added option (not pre-selected dark pattern). Avoids the 23% trust reduction from pre-selected subscriptions. However, cannot definitively confirm default state from static screenshot - filled button could indicate page state after user interaction or unfortunate default. If subscription IS pre-selected by default, this would violate UK CMA guidance and be severe dark pattern (score would drop to 2/10).
