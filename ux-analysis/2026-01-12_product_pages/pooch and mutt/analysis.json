High-quality photography with consistent brand aesthetic. Lifestyle imagery shows product in context with golden retriever dog. Product packaging clearly visible with brand identity. Mobile view shows swipeable image carousel. However, no visible zoom icons or indicators for high-resolution zoom capability. No visible descriptive text or graphics overlaid on images highlighting key features (e.g., callouts for specific ingredients or benefits). No 360-degree view or video demonstration visible.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Meets baseline for multiple images (4-5 views exceeds minimum) and includes contextual lifestyle imagery, which aligns with best practices. However, falls short of Baymard's finding that 52% of sites lack descriptive text/graphics on images - this site is part of that majority. Cannot verify pinch-to-zoom support from static screenshots (40% of mobile sites don't support this per Baymard 2025).

Button appears large and thumb-friendly for mobile. Text is clear and action-oriented. Button is positioned within a dedicated purchase section that includes price, quantity selector, and subscription options. Stock availability appears to be indicated ('Buy now with ShopPay' suggests in-stock). Visual hierarchy is clear with the button being the most prominent interactive element in the buy section. Cart icon in header shows numerical badge, suggesting post-add feedback is implemented.",

No separate 'Buy Now' button that bypasses cart for immediate purchase. The ShopPay button is present but appears less prominent than the primary CTA due to lighter color treatment.",

Research shows sites with Apple Pay/Google Pay see 2x faster purchase completion. The single ShopPay option is better than nothing but represents a major competitive gap.

IMPORTANT: From visual inspection of the UI state, the subscription option does NOT appear to be pre-selected by default. The toggle appears neutral without visual indication of pre-selection (no filled circle or highlighted state visible on subscription side in initial view). Users must actively select subscription. Value proposition is crystal clear: 'Subscribe & save 15% off £14.99 £12.74' with specific savings shown. Frequency selector visible ('Every 1 Month') with ability to adjust. Subscription positioned prominently but on equal footing with one-time purchase, not manipulatively favored.

Unlike the 27% manipulation increase from pre-selected defaults documented by UK CMA research, this interface respects user agency. Clearly communicates 15% savings value proposition. Transparent cancellation terms meet Nielsen Norman Group standards. Subscription visibility and prominence are strong without being manipulative.
