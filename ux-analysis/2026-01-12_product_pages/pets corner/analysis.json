Main product image is clear and high-resolution showing the Canagan Puppy Free-Range Chicken bag. However, limited variety: no in-use imagery showing dogs eating, no lifestyle shots, no scale reference. Mobile view shows image gallery is present but cannot verify pinch-to-zoom functionality from static screenshot. No visible 360-degree view or video demonstration. Images appear functional but minimal - focused on package only.",
      "comparison_to_benchmarks": "Falls below the Nielsen Norman Group benchmark of 5+ product images seeing 19% higher conversion. Has exactly 4 distinct views which meets minimum but not optimal. Missing the contextual in-use imagery that Baymard Institute research shows 56% of users cite as most important. Cannot verify from screenshot if the 52% pitfall of lacking descriptive text/graphics on images applies, but visible thumbnails appear to be straight product shots without overlay text highlighting features.",

Post-add feedback visible via cart badge in header showing '0' items currently. Quantity controls (minus/plus buttons) are cleanly integrated. The button meets mobile touch target requirements based on visual inspection.",

Wait - correcting analysis: The 'One time' option has a filled circle (•) indicating it IS SELECTED BY DEFAULT.
