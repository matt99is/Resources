    <!-- Section 01: The Opportunity -->
    <section id="opportunity" class="section">
      <div class="section-header">
        <span class="section-number">01</span>
        <h2 class="section-title">The Opportunity</h2>
      </div>

      <p>The business needed ways to increase average order value. Meanwhile, sitting on the buy it again roadmap was a future phase: a redesigned minibasket that would give users reasons to add more before checkout.</p>

      <p>The proposal had two parts.</p>

      <p>First, a <strong>free delivery progress bar</strong>. Users would see exactly how far they were from the threshold. Clear, simple, motivating.</p>

      <p>Second, <strong>product recommendations</strong> surfaced at the moment of commitment. When someone adds to their basket, they're already in buying mode. Show them something relevant and you've got a natural path to a bigger order.</p>

      <p>The timing was right. I proposed pulling this work forward.</p>

    <!-- Section 02: The Question -->
    <section id="question" class="section">
      <div class="section-header">
        <span class="section-number">02</span>
        <h2 class="section-title">The Question</h2>
      </div>

      <p>The free delivery bar was straightforward. Show progress, update it when items are added. Users understood it immediately and it was well received in testing.</p>

      <p>The recommendations were more complex. When a user adds a recommended product from within the modal, what should happen? Should the product move somewhere? Should they be able to change the quantity? What layout works best?</p>

      <p>These details matter. Get them wrong and you create confusion instead of conversions.</p>

    <!-- Section 03: AI-Assisted Prototyping -->
    <section id="prototyping" class="section">
      <div class="section-header">
        <span class="section-number">03</span>
        <h2 class="section-title">Building the Prototypes</h2>
      </div>

      <p>I built four fully functional prototypes using AI-assisted development. Each one tested a different combination of two variables: whether the product moves to the basket area when added, and whether users can adjust the quantity.</p>

      <p>These weren't wireframes or click-throughs. They were working prototypes with real interactions, built with proper accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support.</p>

      <p>Part of this was practical. I needed prototypes robust enough to test with assistive technology users. But I also wanted to see how far AI-assisted prototyping could go. Could I build something production-quality fast enough to ship within weeks?</p>

      <p>The answer was yes.</p>

        <span class="section-number">04</span>
        <h2 class="section-title">Testing With Two Groups</h2>
      </div>

      <p>I ran the research through usertesting.com with two separate groups.</p>

      <div class="two-column">
        <div>
          <h3>Regular Customers</h3>
          <p>Tested all four interaction variants, then compared two layout options: a central modal versus a side panel.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Assistive Technology Users</h3>
          <p>I wanted to make sure the design worked for everyone, not just assume it did. This was the first time UX had run this kind of testing at the company.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout--success">
        <p class="callout-label">Key finding</p>
        <p>Both groups pointed to the same winner. The assistive technology group validated that the interaction was clear and fully navigable.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 05: The Winner -->
    <section id="winner" class="section">
      <div class="section-header">
        <span class="section-number">05</span>
        <h2 class="section-title">Variant C + Side Panel</h2>
      </div>

      <p>When users add a recommendation, the product moves up into the basket area. The "Add to basket" button becomes a quantity selector. The total updates immediately.</p>

      <p>Users called it "straightforward" and "simple." The movement confirmed their action. The quantity controls gave them flexibility. Nobody got confused.</p>

      <div class="cta-box">
        <h3>Try the interactive prototype</h3>

      <p>The other variants each broke one of two rules.</p>

      <div class="two-column">
        <div>
          <h3>Visual Feedback</h3>
          <p>When users add something, they need to see it happen. Variants B and D kept the product in place after adding. Users weren't sure it had worked. "Where did my item go?"</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Quantity Control</h3>
          <p>Users expect to adjust quantities. It's standard e-commerce functionality. Variants E and D removed this, and users noticed immediately. "I can't change the quantity!"</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="comparison-grid">
        <div class="comparison-grid__item comparison-grid__item--good">

          <p>Product stayed in place. Users unsure if it worked.</p>

          <p>No quantity controls. Users couldn't adjust amounts.</p>

      <p>The combination of the free delivery progress bar and recommendations gave users both the motivation and the means to add more.</p>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <h3>Small interventions can move meaningful metrics</h3>
          <p>This wasn't a full redesign. It was a focused change at a high-value moment in the journey. Two features working together, details tested properly, shipped fast.</p>
