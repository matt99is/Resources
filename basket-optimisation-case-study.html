      <h2 class="section-number__title">The Problem</h2>
    </div>

    <p>In October 2025, 268,614 customers viewed their basket. Almost 120,000 of them left without clicking checkout. Only 8.79% returned organically to complete their purchase.</p>

    <p>These aren't window shoppers. They've already decided to buy. They've found products, added them to their basket. Something at this final stage is stopping them.</p>

    <div class="metrics-grid">
      <div class="metric">
        <span class="metric__value" style="color: var(--status-error);">44.6%</span>
        <span class="metric__label">Left without clicking checkout</span>
      </div>
      <div class="metric">

        <span class="metric__label">Unclaimed baskets per month</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--warning">
      <span class="callout__label">The insight that made this clear</span>
      <p>First-time visitors abandon at 35%. Returning users, people who know the site and trust the brand, abandon at 48%. That's a 37% higher abandonment rate for experienced users. When your most familiar customers struggle more than newcomers, the problem isn't trust or product selection. It's the experience itself.</p>

  <!-- Section 02: The Evidence -->
  <section class="content-section content-section--alt">
    <div class="section-number">
      <span class="section-number__num">02</span>
      <h2 class="section-number__title">The Evidence</h2>
    </div>

    <p>I audited the current basket against Baymard Institute guidelines. The result: 6 high-impact violations and only 2 areas meeting best practice.</p>

    <p>The major violations included no save for later functionality, no undo option for removed items, dropdown quantity selectors instead of +/- buttons, inability to edit product variants in the cart, small product thumbnails making it hard to verify items, and missing free shipping threshold information in the order summary.</p>

    <p>The page did meet standards in two areas: showing the full order cost including delivery at the cart step, and keeping the discount code field collapsed behind a link to avoid distraction.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="images/Baymard_Violations.png" alt="Current basket page annotated with Baymard violations showing 6 BAD ratings" class="lightbox-trigger">

    <div class="callout callout--warning">

      <p>Current rating: Poor. The goal is to reach Perfect by addressing all identified violations in the redesign.</p>

  <!-- Section 03: The Research -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <div class="section-number">
      <span class="section-number__num">03</span>
      <h2 class="section-number__title">The Research</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The Baymard audit showed we were failing standards. But I needed to understand how users actually think about the basket and what competitors were doing. I ran three additional research streams.</p>

    <div class="research-grid">
      <div class="research-card">
        <h3 class="research-card__title">Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p class="research-card__description">16 pet retail sites analysed against 11 UX criteria. Built a tool with Claude Code to automate the process. What would have taken weeks took days.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="research-card">
        <h3 class="research-card__title">Feature Importance Rankings</h3>
        <p class="research-card__description">Asked users to rank 10 basket features by importance. Checkout CTA and Basket Totals ranked #1 and #2. Neither is prominent above the fold on our current page.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="research-card">
        <h3 class="research-card__title">Card Sorting</h3>
        <p class="research-card__description">Tested how users naturally group basket features. No two participants organised them the same way, revealing fundamental information architecture problems.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--info">
      <span class="callout__label">Key finding from competitor analysis</span>
      <p>Subscription options are absent from 60% of competitors. Express checkout options and delivery timing information are also weak across the market. These are opportunities to differentiate, not just catch up.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 04: The Approach -->
  <section class="content-section content-section--alt">
    <div class="section-number">
      <span class="section-number__num">04</span>
      <h2 class="section-number__title">The Approach</h2>
    </div>

    <p>This isn't a redesign for redesign's sake. Every change in the prototype relates directly to Baymard best practices, competitor analysis findings, or user research. Engineering was involved from the start to ensure feasibility.</p>

    <div class="process-steps">

    </div>

    <p>I started with 4-6 basic wireframes focused on information architecture before moving to interactions. The wireframes were built with detailed annotations explaining the rationale for each decision.</p>

      <h2 class="section-number__title">User Feedback</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The lo-fi prototype was tested on usertesting.com and internally. The feedback validated the approach and highlighted areas for refinement.</p>

    <div class="quote-grid">
      <div class="quote-card">

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout--info">
      <span class="callout__label">Actionable feedback</span>
      <p>One user noted that "Save" as a label was unclear: "I wouldn't really know that would be to take the product away. Maybe if there was a clearer way of saying that with sort of language." This kind of feedback drives iteration.</p>

      <h2 class="section-number__title">The Prototype</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The hi-fi prototype isn't a static design. It's a fully functional, accessible React build with real interactions and configurable variants for A/B testing different approaches.</p>

    <p>Key features include full checkout flow, save for later, subscription setup, delivery method selection, variant/quantity editing, free delivery progress, undo functionality, and complete responsive design with accessibility built in.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <span class="callout__label">Try the live prototype</span>
      <p>The prototype is fully interactive and demonstrates the complete basket experience with configurable variants for A/B testing.</p>

    <p>The next step is user testing on the hi-fi prototype, followed by building an implementation roadmap. This won't ship all at once. It will be integrated piece by piece, with each change measured for impact.</p>

    <div class="callout callout--tip">
      <span class="callout__label">The fix for basket persistence</span>
      <p>The technical issue that started this investigation, basket persistence across sessions, is now in development. This paves the way for the abandoned basket email that originally surfaced the problem.</p>
