    <!-- Section 01: The Opportunity -->

      </div>

      <p>In October 2025, 268,614 customers viewed their basket. Almost 120,000 of them left without clicking checkout. Only 8.79% returned organically to complete their purchase.</p>

      <p>These aren't window shoppers. They've already decided to buy. They've found products, added them to their basket. Something at this final stage is stopping them.</p>

      <div class="metrics-grid">
        <div class="metric">
          <div class="metric-value">44.6%</div>

      <div class="pull-quote">
        <p>"No two users organised basket features identically — a clear signal of fundamental information architecture problems."</p>
      </div>

      <p>Rather than guessing at solutions, I proposed a structured research approach using Baymard Institute methodology. The initial audit revealed our current basket experience rated as "POOR" with a net score of -2.4.</p>

        <span class="section-number">02</span>
        <h2 class="section-title">Research Methodology</h2>
      </div>

      <p>I combined quantitative analysis with qualitative research methods to build a comprehensive picture of user behaviour and pain points.</p>

      <h3>Baymard Audit</h3>

      <p>I audited the current basket against Baymard Institute guidelines. The result: 6 high-impact violations and only 2 areas meeting best practice.</p>

      <p>The major violations included no save for later functionality, no undo option for removed items, dropdown quantity selectors instead of +/- buttons, inability to edit product variants in the cart, small product thumbnails making it hard to verify items, and missing free shipping threshold information in the order summary.</p>

      <p>The page did meet standards in two areas: showing the full order cost including delivery at the cart step, and keeping the discount code field collapsed behind a link to avoid distraction.</p>

      <div class="callout callout--insight">
        <p class="callout-label">The Baymard verdict</p>
        <p>Current rating: Poor. The goal is to reach Perfect by addressing all identified violations in the redesign.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>

      <p>16 pet retail sites analysed against 11 UX criteria. Built a tool with Claude Code to automate the process. What would have taken weeks took days.</p>

      <h3>Feature Importance Rankings</h3>

      <p>Asked users to rank 10 basket features by importance. Checkout CTA and Basket Totals ranked #1 and #2. Neither is prominent above the fold on our current page.</p>

      <h3>Card Sorting</h3>

      <p>Tested how users naturally group basket features. No two participants organised them the same way, revealing fundamental information architecture problems.</p>

      <div class="callout callout--insight">
        <p class="callout-label">Key finding from competitor analysis</p>
        <p>Subscription options are absent from 60% of competitors. Express checkout options and delivery timing information are also weak across the market. These are opportunities to differentiate, not just catch up.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Design Process</h2>
      </div>

      <p>This isn't a redesign for redesign's sake. Every change in the prototype relates directly to Baymard best practices, competitor analysis findings, or user research. Engineering was involved from the start to ensure feasibility.</p>

      <p>I started with 4-6 basic wireframes focused on information architecture before moving to interactions. The wireframes were built with detailed annotations explaining the rationale for each decision.</p>

      <p>The lo-fi prototype was tested on usertesting.com and internally. The feedback validated the approach and highlighted areas for refinement.</p>

      <div class="callout callout--insight">
        <p class="callout-label">Actionable feedback</p>
        <p>One user noted that "Save" as a label was unclear: "I wouldn't really know that would be to take the product away. Maybe if there was a clearer way of saying that with sort of language." This kind of feedback drives iteration.</p>

        <span class="section-number">05</span>
        <h2 class="section-title">The Prototype</h2>
      </div>

      <p>The hi-fi prototype isn't a static design. It's a fully functional, accessible React build with real interactions and configurable variants for A/B testing different approaches.</p>

      <p>Key features include full checkout flow, save for later, subscription setup, delivery method selection, variant/quantity editing, free delivery progress, undo functionality, and complete responsive design with accessibility built in.</p>

      <p>The next step is user testing on the hi-fi prototype, followed by building an implementation roadmap. This won't ship all at once. It will be integrated piece by piece, with each change measured for impact.</p>

        <p>The technical issue that started this investigation, basket persistence across sessions, is now in development. This paves the way for the abandoned basket email that originally surfaced the problem.</p>
