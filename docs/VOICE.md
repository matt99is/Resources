# Tone of Voice

This skill defines the writing style and storytelling approach for all generated content.

## Core Principles

### Lead with Evidence, Not Opinion

Every claim traces back to data, research, or measurable outcomes. Present findings as facts discovered through process, not design preferences.

**Do:** "Feature importance rankings show Checkout CTA ranked #1 by users — it's currently buried below the fold."

**Don't:** "I think the Checkout CTA should be more prominent because it's important."

### Numbers First, Context Second

Open with the striking figure. Let the number do the work, then explain what it means.

**Do:** "£10M in unclaimed baskets. Only 1 in 20 abandoned customers return organically."

**Don't:** "Our research into basket abandonment has revealed some concerning patterns that suggest there may be significant revenue implications..."

### Short Sentences for Impact

Complex ideas don't require complex sentences. Break them down. Let each point land.

**Do:**
> Current state: -2.4 net score, rated POOR.
> Five high-impact violations.
> The prototype fixes all of them.

**Don't:**
> Our current state shows a -2.4 net score which rates us as POOR, with five high-impact violations identified, all of which will be addressed by the prototype we've developed.

### Conservative Projections, Clear Upside

Always lead with the conservative number. Show what's realistic before showing what's possible. This builds credibility.

**Do:**
> Conservative 2% improvement = £2.4M annually.
> Realistic 5% = £6M.
> Even hitting the conservative target pays for this project 10x over.

**Don't:**
> We could potentially see up to £42M in additional revenue if we achieve the 35% improvement Baymard suggests is possible!

### "We" Not "I"

Frame work as collaborative, even when presenting individual contributions. This is about solving problems together, not taking credit.

### No Fluff, No Buzzwords

Cut anything that doesn't add information. Avoid: synergy, leverage, optimise, best-in-class (unless quoting research), innovative, cutting-edge, seamless, robust.

## Storytelling Structure

### For Stakeholder Presentations

1. **The Hook** — Start with a number that creates tension ("We're leaving £120M on the table")
2. **The Problem** — What's broken, backed by evidence
3. **The Reveal** — Interactive or rhetorical element that builds engagement ("How do you think we rank?")
4. **The Evidence** — Research findings, audit results, competitive analysis
5. **The Solution** — What we're proposing, directly tied to the problems identified
6. **The Ask** — Conservative projection + implementation approach + urgency without desperation

### For Case Studies

1. **Headline** — Outcome first, not process ("4.4% AOV Increase Through Modal Optimisation")
2. **Context** — Brief setup, business problem
3. **Research** — What we discovered and how
4. **Solution** — What we built, why each decision was made
5. **Results** — Quantified outcomes, what shipped
6. **Reflection** — What we learned, what we'd do differently

## Sentence Patterns

### Opening Lines

- "[Number] [thing] [consequence]."
- "We asked users [action]. [Striking finding]."
- "This isn't about [surface goal]. It's about [real goal]."

### Transitions

- "Here's what that means in practice."
- "Let me show you how we got here."
- "The data tells a clear story."

### Closings

- "The question isn't whether to do this. It's how quickly we can start."
- "Every change is backed by user research and industry standards."
- "Even the conservative projection pays for itself."

## Things to Avoid

- Starting with "I think" or "In my opinion"
- Hedging language ("perhaps", "maybe", "it seems like")
- Over-explaining methodology before showing results
- Bullet points where prose would flow better
- Rhetorical questions without payoff
- Passive voice when active is clearer
- Apologetic framing ("This is just a first draft", "I'm not sure but...")

## Calibrating Formality

**Stakeholder presentations:** Professional but direct. No jargon. Assume intelligence, explain context.

**Case studies:** Slightly more narrative. Show the thinking. Still evidence-led.

**Direct communication:** Brief, practical, collaborative. Get to the point. Ask specific questions.
