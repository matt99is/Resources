# Writing Examples

Real examples demonstrating the tone of voice in practice.

## Opening Hooks

### Strong

> "We're leaving £120 million on the table every year."

> "52.5% of customers who add items abandon their basket."

> "£19M in abandoned baskets isn't just a number. It's half a million customers who wanted to buy but something stopped them."

### Weak (Avoid)

> "This presentation will explore the potential opportunities in our basket experience."

> "I'd like to share some research I've been conducting about our checkout flow."

## Evidence Presentation

### Strong

> **Key Finding:** No two participants organized features identically — our current IA confuses everyone.

> Users told us Checkout CTA is their #1 priority. So we've made it prominent and placed it above the fold.

> Card sorting showed users grouped checkout features together 80% of the time. We've reorganized the entire information architecture around these natural mental models.

### Weak (Avoid)

> "Based on my analysis of the data collected during our research phase, it appears that there may be some discrepancies between user expectations and our current implementation."

## Framing Research

### Strong

> "This isn't my opinion of how it should be organized — it's built directly from how users naturally think about these features."

> "We're not reinventing the wheel — we're implementing documented best practices that the industry has proven work."

> "We're not gambling — we'll have data proving it works before full rollout."

### Weak (Avoid)

> "I believe this approach could potentially yield positive results."

> "In my experience, users typically prefer..."

## Presenter Notes Style

### Strong

> "Let's take a look at how we stack up against competitors and others in the industry. It's not good is it — we're failing baseline e-commerce standards when it comes to basket functionality."

> "Here's how we actually make this happen. We already have the research, the prototype, and engineering buy-in. We build the production version, then A/B test it against the current basket."

### Weak (Avoid)

> "So as you can see from this slide, there are several areas where we could potentially improve, and I wanted to walk you through each of these in detail."

## Calls to Action

### Strong

> "The question isn't whether to do this. It's how quickly can we start."

> "Even hitting the conservative target pays for this project 10x over."

> "Low risk, high confidence based on the research foundation we've built."

### Weak (Avoid)

> "I hope this presentation has been helpful and I welcome any feedback you might have."

> "Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this proposal."

## Slide Copy Patterns

### Problem Slides

> **We're Average. Average Isn't Good Enough.**
> - Industry benchmark: 70.19% abandonment (Baymard Institute, 2024)
> - We're at 52.5% — bang on industry average
> - But here's the problem: our research shows exactly why people abandon, and it's all fixable

### Solution Slides

> **The New Design Fixes All 5 High-Impact Violations:**
> - ✓ Free shipping information clarity and prominence
> - ✓ Product thumbnail sizing and visibility
> - ✓ Save-for-later functionality properly implemented
> - ✓ Clear, unambiguous checkout pathway
> - ✓ Proper information hierarchy

### Impact Slides

> | Improvement | Additional Annual Revenue |
> |-------------|---------------------------|
> | **Conservative 2%** | **£2.4M** |
> | **Realistic 5%** | **£6M** |
>
> *Even hitting the conservative target pays for this project 10x over*
