      <h3>Too Many Systems, No Unified Experience</h3>

      <p>Before ACE, store colleagues were working across a patchwork of disconnected tools.</p>

      <p>A shared iPad ran an outdated system that had been built without UX input and without colleague feedback. It was difficult to use, counter-intuitive, and required too many steps to complete basic tasks.</p>

      <p>Stock taking and ticket printing lived on a separate device. Anything more complex meant walking to the back of the store to use a desktop PC. There was no voice communication between colleagues.</p>

      <p>The result: wasted time, friction at every turn, and a system that worked against the people using it rather than for them.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge</h2>
      </div>

      <h3>Building a System From Scratch</h3>

      <p>The goal was to unify everything into a single device. But this wasn't just a reskin. We needed to replatform dozens of different tasks, each with their own workflows and edge cases.</p>

      <p>That required a design system versatile enough to support rapid UX development across very different features: inventory management, customer accounts, subscriptions, adoption centre processes, click and collect, voice comms.</p>

      <p>There was also a technical constraint. The device runs on Android, but we needed to lock it down for enterprise use. No system buttons, no native Android navigation. Our interface had to handle all navigation itself, comprehensively and intuitively.</p>

      <div class="callout callout--insight">
        <p class="callout-label">The constraint that shaped everything</p>
        <p>With native Android navigation disabled, I had to design a complete navigation system from scratch. It needed to handle app switching, back navigation, home access, and notifications, and be learnable in minutes.</p>

        <span class="section-number">03</span>
        <h2 class="section-title">The Approach</h2>
      </div>

      <h3>Designing With Colleagues, Not For Them</h3>

      <p>I worked directly with store colleagues throughout the process. Not surveys or secondhand feedback, but actually talking to the people who would use this device every day.</p>

      <p>What tasks take the longest? Where do you get stuck? What information do you need and when?</p>

      <p>This shaped everything from the information architecture to the default behaviours. For example, the barcode scanner is the primary input method for most tasks. Scan a product and it opens directly into the inventory system. Scan a customer's Pets Club card and it takes you straight to their account.</p>

      <p>The favourites system came from wanting to follow established patterns. Colleagues already know how their personal Android phones work. Letting them customise their homescreen with the tools they use most meant less learning and faster access.</p>

      <h3>Still Evolving</h3>

      <p>The current project is replacing a desktop system that contains dozens of eForms. Colleagues currently have to leave the shop floor to complete these on a PC in the back.</p>

      <p>We're simplifying this down to 8 forms that will live on the ACE device. Some of these will be completable via AI voice commands, letting colleagues fill in forms while their hands are busy with other tasks.</p>

      <p>The device keeps growing with the needs of the people using it.</p>

      <div class="callout callout--success">
        <p class="callout-label">Coming soon</p>
        <p>AI-powered voice forms, reducing dozens of desktop eForms to 8 mobile-friendly versions.</p>
